    <h3><b>Description</b></h3>
    <p>These ranch chicken tacos are a great change from regular Mexican-style tacos. 
       A quick, cool summer dinner made with leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally, 
       you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to shred 
       it for real tacos.</p>
