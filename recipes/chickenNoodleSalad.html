     <h3><b>Description</b></h3>
     <p>Get ready to make all sorts of friends when you bring a big bowl of this Asian 
        chicken noodle salad to the next big cookout. The only folks you might scare 
        away are the ones who brought regular pasta salads. There's just something 
        delightfully addictive about this special combination of cold and spicy. This 
        recipe is the perfect catchall for all those summer vegetables we're supposed 
        to be eating more of, as well as any dry leftover chicken you have around.</p>
